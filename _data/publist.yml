  description: Todayâ€™s leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability.

  description: We demonstrate, however, that the behaviour of the decoder at scale underutilises this data structure, and that improvements and simplifications can be made to architectural designs to reduce resource overhead in practice.
